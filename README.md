# Advent Of Code2022

My advent of code solutions for 2022 - [Advent Of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022)

### How to run

Solutions are written in C# using [.net 7.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0)<br>
Currently, only the included libraries in .net 7.0 are used.

Each solution for each daily puzzle is separated into folders of their own. To run, open command line, navigate to the correct folder and execute the following.

> dotnet run
